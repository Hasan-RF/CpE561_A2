# CpE561 Assignment 2

In this assignment, I wrote a Page Rank (PR) and Hybrid Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The BFS is implemented using two approaches, one that uses a queue and another that uses an array. Both approaches are tested both sequentially and in parallel and compared to show which provides better results.

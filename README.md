# CpE561 Assignment 2

In this assignment, I wrote a C++ code uses Page Rank (PR) and Hybrid Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms on a randomly generated set of nodes. The BFS is implemented using two approaches, one that uses a queue and another that uses an array. Both approaches are tested both sequentially and in parallel and compared to show which provides better results.

The number of nodes in the graph and the maximum number of links per node can be defined at the start of the code.
